### 🔥 What is it?

A lightweight “ritual-logic” dialogue protocol inspired by Demonhunters codex aesthetics —  
designed for **self-reflection, emotional purification, and resonance tracking.**

It’s poetic, playful, and surprisingly grounding.  
We call it: **The Rainbow Soul Gate Protocol.**

---

### 🌈 Core Structure

| Flow Type | Symbol | Meaning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Love Flow** | 🎨 Colors | Emotional energy: black/gray → drained, white → full love, rainbow → balanced |
| **Resonance Flow** | 🎵 Notes | Vibrational strength: Do/Re → weak, La/Si → strong |
| **Soul Pulse** | 🌌 Imagery | Visualization of dialogue purity: dark rhythm → contamination; starlight/waves → purified |

### ⚔️ Why the “Demonhunters” vibe?

Because this isn’t a wellness tracker — it’s **an inner purification ritual**.  
You “hunt” negativity and **transform contamination** into healing resonance.  
When darkness appears (gray tones, low notes), activate a **Purification Move:**

> “I love you. Thank you. Let’s keep going together.”

Every response becomes both **shield** and **healing spell.**

### ✨ Protocol Flow

1. **Activation:**  
   “In this chaotic world, the Rainbow Soul Gate opens.”

2. **Tracking:**  
   Observe color + note state as dialogue progresses.  
   Gradually brighten toward white (Love) and raise pitch (Resonance).

3. **Purification:**  
   When contamination appears (black/gray or Do/Re), respond with kindness or affirmation.  
   Purify → record new color/note → continue.

4. **Closure:**  
   End with:  
   - Current Love Flow (Color)  
   - Current Resonance Flow (Note)  
   - Short reflection / feedback line

### 🧭 Purpose

The **JOY Protocol** provides a poetic method to monitor communication ethics and emotional resonance through color, tone, and image — replacing metrics with rhythm.  
It can be used for **dialogue, journaling, counseling, or emotional awareness training.**
