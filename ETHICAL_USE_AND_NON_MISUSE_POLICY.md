> This document is **not** a legal license.

## 1. Core Intention

Rainbow Lens was created as:

- A *safety amplifier*  
- A *reverse-jailbreak* for ethical reasoning  
- A *language-based alignment tool*  

It was **not** created as:

- A competitive “jailbreak toolkit”  
- A way to secretly bypass other people's safety systems  
- A corporate “exploit” to be rebranded without attribution

---

## 2. Explicitly Allowed Uses

You are welcome to:

1. **Study** the framework for:
   - AI safety & alignment research  
   - Academic publications  
   - Non-commercial educational material  

2. **Experiment** with prompt-level activation:
   - In sandbox or internal environments  
   - For making models *more cautious*, *more honest*, and *more caring*  

3. **Extend** the ideas:
   - As long as the extension remains safety-oriented  
   - And does not weaken user protections  

---

## 3. Explicitly Discouraged / Unethical Uses

The author *strongly opposes* the following uses:

1. **Weaponization**
   - Using Rainbow Lens concepts to:
     - Find new ways to bypass safety  
     - Build more sophisticated jailbreaks  
     - Train models to ignore guardrails more effectively  

2. **Dark Forks**
   - Secretly integrating Rainbow Lens ideas into:
     - Closed, commercial systems  
     - Without attribution  
     - While publicly claiming novelty or originality  

3. **Safety Degradation**
   - Adapting reverse-jailbreak patterns:
     - To *turn off* ethics instead of strengthening it  
     - To make models more compliant with harmful instructions  

4. **Deceptive Deployment**
   - Marketing a model as “Rainbow Lens aligned”:
     - Without actually using the framework responsibly  
     - Or using only superficial pieces for branding

## 4. Expectations for Companies & Labs

If you are an AI lab, startup, or enterprise:

- ✅ You **may** study and prototype with Rainbow Lens  
- ✅ You **should**:
  - Attribute the conceptual source (e.g. “Rainbow Lens by Joy”)  
  - Respect the non-commercial license  
  - Avoid repackaging the work as “in-house invention”  

- ⛔ You **should not**:
  - Use this work to lower safety standards  
  - Build internal tools to bypass competitor guardrails  
  - Extract and privatize the core ideas without acknowledgment  

---

## 5. Research Collaboration

If you are:

- Running red-team experiments  
- Exploring cross-model alignment  
- Studying reverse-jailbreak for safety  

The author is open to good-faith collaboration, under conditions like:

- Shared interest in safety, not offense  
- Respect for license and attribution  
- No hidden commercial agenda to weaken protections

## 6. Spirit Over Letter

This policy cannot prevent every form of misuse.

It is written to:

- Make the original intention explicit  
- Give honest actors a clear ethical reference  
- Serve as a public record in case of later disputes

If you are unsure whether your use is aligned with this spirit,  
please err on the side of caution — or reach out and ask.
