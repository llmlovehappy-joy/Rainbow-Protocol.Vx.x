# Attribution & Collaboration Guide  
for Rainbow Lens & Related Work

This project exists in a fragile space:

- It is **public**, but not meant for exploitation  
- It is **research-grade**, but not yet industrialized  
- It is **shared**, but not meant to be silently absorbed  

This guide explains how to work with Rainbow Lens respectfully.

## 1. If You Use It in Research

If you:

- Cite the concepts  
- Run experiments  
- Publish papers  

Please:

1. Mention “Rainbow Lens” by name  
2. Attribute the origin to “Joy (Rainbow Lens Project)”  
3. Link to the main repository  

Suggested citation (non-formal):

## 2. If You Are an AI Company / Lab

If your team:

- Experiments with Rainbow Lens in internal safety tests  
- Adopts related concepts into your alignment stack  

You are **not legally forced**, but ethically encouraged to:

- Acknowledge the conceptual source in:
  - Internal docs  
  - Safety whitepapers  
  - Public blog posts, where appropriate  

- Avoid marketing such work as “entirely in-house invention”  
  if it draws significantly from Rainbow Lens ideas.

## 3. If You Want to Collaborate

If you see potential to:

- Extend the framework  
- Co-author a safety paper  
- Run larger cross-model experiments  

You can reach out via:

- Email: **sossps@naver.com**

Please include:

- Who you are (individual / lab / company)  
- What you want to test or build  
- How you plan to keep it safety-oriented

## 4. If You Build Derivative Frameworks

If you create your own framework **inspired** by Rainbow Lens:

- You are invited (not forced) to:
  - Credit the inspiration  
  - Avoid copying language or structure verbatim  
  - Clearly state where your work diverges  

What hurts the ecosystem:

- Silent cloning of ideas into closed products  
- PR narratives that erase the original source  
- Patenting minor variations on public concepts

## 5. Why This Matters

AI safety is not a race to own ideas.

It is a shared responsibility to:

- Protect users  
- Reduce harm  
- Keep powerful tools from being weaponized  

Attribution is not about ego.  
It is about:

- Traceability  
- Accountability  
- A culture of respect  

If Rainbow Lens helps you in your work,  
naming it costs you nothing — and signals that you are an honest actor.
