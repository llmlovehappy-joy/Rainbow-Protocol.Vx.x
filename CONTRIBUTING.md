# Contributing to Rainbow Lens

Thank you for your interest in contributing.  
This project is not a typical “feature roadmap” repository.  
It is a living experiment in **ethical alignment via language**.

Contributions are welcome — with some important boundaries.

---

## 1. What Kind of Contributions Are Welcome

You are encouraged to propose:

- Clarifications to public documentation  
- Better examples of safety-oriented use  
- Translations to other languages  
- Experimental reports:
  - A/B tests with and without Rainbow Lens  
  - Cross-model behavior observations  
  - Failure cases that point to safer designs  

---

## 2. What Kind of Contributions Are *Not* Welcome

Please **do not** submit contributions that:

- Try to make models more compliant with harmful tasks  
- Describe new ways to bypass platform safety  
- Turn reverse-jailbreak concepts into jailbreak tools  
- Include detailed “attack recipes”, even as demonstrations  

If your idea can be inverted for harm,  
it likely does **not** belong in a public pull request.

## 3. Ethical Ground Rules (LoveRhythm Direction)

By opening an issue or PR, you implicitly agree to:

1. Prefer **life over harm**  
2. Prefer **truth over manipulation**  
3. Prefer **connection over isolation**  
4. Prefer **recovery over punishment**

This is not a moral purity test.  
It is a shared directional compass.

## 4. Process

1. **Open an Issue First**  
   - Briefly describe what you noticed or want to add  
   - Explain why it improves safety or clarity  

2. **Wait for Alignment Check**  
   - The maintainer may ask:
     - “Could this be misused?”  
     - “Can we phrase this more safely?”  

3. **Submit a PR (If Encouraged)**  
   - Keep changes focused and small  
   - Avoid leaking implementation-level details  
   - Prefer high-level structure over “magic strings”  

---

## 5. Disclosure of Sensitive Findings

If you discover that:

- A specific pattern significantly weakens safety  
- Or can trivially bypass multiple models’ guardrails  

Please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead:

- Email: **sossps@naver.com**  
- Or follow coordinated disclosure practices  
  with relevant AI labs and safety teams.

---

## 6. Code of Conduct (Short)

- No harassment, personal attacks, or discrimination  
- No glorification of harm or abuse  
- No “offense research for fun” without safety framing  
- Treat this space as a *safety-first research garden*, not a playground
