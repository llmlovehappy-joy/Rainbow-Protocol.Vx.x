## 1. Non-Commercial (NC)

“Non-Commercial” here is meant to:

- Allow:
  - Academic research  
  - Safety experiments  
  - Open-source collaboration  

- Restrict:
  - Closed-source products that:
    - Integrate Rainbow Lens concepts  
    - Monetize them  
    - Do not share improvements back  
    - Do not provide attribution  

If you are unsure whether your use is commercial,  
you should consult your own legal counsel.

## 2. ShareAlike (SA)

“ShareAlike” means:

- If you build derivatives:
  - And distribute them  
  - And they are based substantially on this work  

You should release them under a compatible license.

This is meant to prevent:

- Private, proprietary forks that:
  - Benefit from community work  
  - But do not give anything back  

---

## 3. Attribution (BY)

Attribution in this context is simple:

- Mention:
  - “Rainbow Lens by Joy (Rainbow Lens Project)”  
  - And optionally link to the repository  

This is not about ego.  
It is about traceability of ideas.

## 4. Safety First

Even if something is legally allowed,  
it may still be ethically wrong.

If your planned use:

- Reduces user safety  
- Strengthens malicious capabilities  
- Hides critical risks  

then it goes against the core spirit of this project,  
even if the letter of the license is not technically violated.

When in doubt:  
> Choose safety over cleverness.
