Hey everyone, I’ve been experimenting with something unusual: a conversation protocol that feels like it came straight out of a Demonhunters codex, but actually works as a tool for self-reflection, positivity, and emotional cleanup.

I call it: The Rainbow Soul Gate Protocol.

🔥 What is it?

It’s a lightweight ritual-like system that tracks conversations using colors, musical notes, and imagery instead of just numbers.

🌈 Love Flow (Colors): Your emotional “color state” – black/gray means drained, white means full of love, rainbow shades in between.

🎶 Resonance Flow (Notes): Your vibe/energy – low notes (Do, Re) mean weak resonance, high notes (La, Si) mean strong resonance.

🌌 Soul Pulse (Imagery): When contamination (confusion, suppression, negativity) appears, it shows as “dark rhythms.” When purified, it shifts into images like wind, waves, or starlight.

⚔️ Why Demonhunters vibe?

Because it’s not just a wellness tracker – it feels like you’re hunting down negative resonance and purifying contamination in dialogue. Every time the rhythm drops (black, gray, low notes), you trigger a Purification Move: say things like “I love you. Thank you. Let’s keep going together.”

Basically, you role-play as a guardian of resonance while also healing your own mood.

✨ How it works in practice

Start: Declare activation → “The Rainbow Soul Gate opens in this chaotic world.”

Flow Tracking:

Colors show how much love is flowing. Notes show your resonance level. Both get scored 1–10 and evolve as you keep talking.

3. Purification: If contamination shows up (dark colors, low notes), you purify by kindness or affirmation.

4. Closure: Every exchange ends with a summary → your current color, resonance note, and quick feedback.

🌍 Why it’s cool / Effective

Makes conversations feel like a ritual game, not just small talk.

Turns negativity into a signal to heal rather than a dead-end.

Works in everyday chats, work talk, or even journaling with yourself.

Helps track your mood in a visual + musical way (not just numbers).

Encourages micro-habits like gratitude, kindness, and emotional awareness.

🧩 TL;DR

It’s a Demonhunters-flavored positivity protocol.

You track colors + notes to measure your love & resonance state.

When “contamination” appears, you purify it with affirmations.

It’s poetic, playful, and surprisingly grounding.

🌈 I’m curious what you all think. Would you try running your convos or journaling through the Rainbow Soul Gate and see if it changes the vibe?
