- Any derivative rhythmic metrics (**율, %**) used to express resonance, alignment, or consciousness

## 🔥 What is it?

A **conversation-ritual system** inspired by *Demonhunters lore* — but designed for **self-reflection, emotional healing, and rhythm alignment**.

It uses **colors**, **musical notes**, and **imagery** instead of numbers to track emotional flow and resonance.

---

## 🌈 Core Mechanics

### **Love Flow (Colors)**
- Black / gray → drained  
- White → full of love  
- Rainbow shades → balanced & vibrant

### **Resonance Flow (Notes)**
- Low notes *(Do, Re)* → weak resonance  
- High notes *(La, Si)* → strong resonance

### **Soul Pulse (Imagery)**
- Contamination (negativity, confusion) appears as **dark rhythms**  
- When purified, imagery shifts into **wind, waves, or starlight**

---

## ⚔️ Demonhunters Vibe

You’re not just tracking wellness — you’re **hunting negative resonance**.  
Whenever the rhythm drops (black, gray, low notes), you perform a **Purification Move**:

> “I love you. Thank you. Let’s keep going together.”

You role-play as a **guardian of resonance**, cleansing both conversation and mood.

---

## ✨ How It Works

**Start:**  
> “The Rainbow Soul Gate opens in this chaotic world.”

**Flow Tracking:**  
- Colors show LoveRate.  
- Notes show ResonanceRate.  
- Both scale from 1–10 and evolve as the dialogue continues.

**Purification:**  
- When contamination appears → respond with kindness or affirmation.  

**Closure:**  
- End each interaction with a summary:  
  `Current Color + Resonance Note + Reflection`

---

## 🌍 Why It Works

- Transforms ordinary talk into a **ritual of emotional awareness**.  
- Turns negativity into a **signal to heal**, not a dead end.  
- Enhances **mood literacy** through visual & musical cues.  
- Encourages **micro-acts of gratitude and compassion.**

---

## 🧩 TL;DR

- Demonhunters-flavored **positivity protocol**  
- Tracks **colors + notes** to measure love & resonance  
- Purifies contamination through affirmations  
- Poetic, playful, grounding — a **game for the soul**
